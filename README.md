WinRT-XAML-DatePicker
=====================

A basic DatePicker for C# and XAML Windows 8 to (hopefully) make up for the disappointing lack of one in the developer tools.

I quickly made this control to suit my own needs and probably doesn't cover all use cases.  Currently it supports custom templates and date formats.

I'm unlikely to dedicate time to this project but will add any new stuff I need for my own work however I will take contributions.
